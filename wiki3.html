    From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia <br>
    <p>Java is a <a href="">high-level, class-based, object-oriented programming language</a> that is designed to have as few implementation <a href="">dependencies</a> as possible. It is a general-purpose programming language intended to let <a href="">programmers</a> write once, run anywhere <a href="">(WORA)</a>,[16] meaning that compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support Java without the need to recompile.<a href="">[17]</a> Java applications are typically compiled to <a href="">bytecode</a> that can run on any <a href="">Java virtual machine</a> (JVM) regardless of the underlying <a href="">computer architecture</a>. Although its <a href="">syntax</a> is similar to that of <a href="">C</a> and <a href="">C++</a>, the Java language has fewer <a href="">low-level</a> facilities than either of them. The Java runtime provides dynamic capabilities (such as <a href="">reflection</a> and runtime code modification) that are typically not available in traditional compiled languages.

        Java gained popularity shortly after its release, and has been a very popular programming language since then.[18] Java was the third most popular programming language in 2022 according to GitHub.[19] Although still widely popular, there has been a gradual decline in use of Java in recent years with other languages using JVM gaining popularity.[20]</p>
