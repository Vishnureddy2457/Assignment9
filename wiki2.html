    From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia <br>
    <p>Python is a <a href="">programming language</a>. It was made to be <a href="">open source</a> and easy to read. A <a href="">Dutch</a> programmer named <a href="">Guido van Rossum</a> made Python in 1991. He named it after the <a href="">television program Monty Python's Flying Circus</a>. Many Python examples and tutorials include jokes from the show. <a href="">[31]</a></p>

       <p> Python is an <a href="">interpreted language</a>. Interpreted languages do not need to be <a href="">compiled</a> to run. A program called an <a href="">interpreter</a> runs Python code on almost any kind of computer. This means that a programmer can change the code and quickly see the results. This also means Python is slower than a compiled language like <a href="">C</a>, because it is not turned into <a href="">machine code ahead of time</a>. Instead, this happens as the program is running.</p>
        
       <p> Python's developers try to avoid changing the language to make it better until they have a lot of things to change. Also, they try not to make small repairs, called patches, to unimportant parts of CPython, the main version of Python, even if the patches would make it faster. When speed is important, a Python programmer can write some of the program in a different language, like C, or use PyPy, a different kind of Python that uses a <a href="">just-in-time compiler</a> .</p>
        
        <p>Keeping Python fun to use is an important goal of Pythonâ€™s developers. It reflects in the language's name, a tribute to the British comedy group Monty Python. Tutorials often take a playful approach, such as referring to spam and eggs instead of the standard <a href="">foo and bar</a>.</p>
